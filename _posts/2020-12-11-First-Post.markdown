Finally I success build my blog first post by `jekyll`! it's not so hard.

Why I choose this way to host my blog is due to this [post][outlink1], it raise 4 good reason to do this.

1. Can use markdown to write blogs.
2. Can use git to manage posts and deploy
3. Can host on GitHub pages freely.
4. Can customize pages, extend all plugin by myself.

And as a coder, I think need to host blogger more geek way. If you are interesting about this way also. 
Can just refer to [Jekyll site][jekyll-site], to install jekyll in seconds. and push to github page to host static contents. 

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight c# %}
// if statement without an else
if (condition)
{
    then-statement;
}
// Next statement in the program.
{% endhighlight %}

This is really useful, before this I need to paste some `<pre class="prettyprint">` tag to show my code snippets. with this new feature, I can share code snippet more easily :).

I am so satisfy with my new blogger. although I have many thing need to understand.
